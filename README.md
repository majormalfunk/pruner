#### Overview
Pruner is a helper app for attending a multi-day multi-venue event e.g. a film festival where there are several exhibitions at the same time in different locations. Pruner helps attendees narrow down possible choices based on given preferences thus pruning out implausible choices.

Pruning is done by selecting possible dates and times, must-sees, and other criteria and then presenting the user with feasible tracks to follow which can be narrowed down further.

In order for pruner to work it has to have the event schedule and a list of event venues and other details.
A registered user can create event timetables. Timetables can be private or public. All users can prune public events.
Registered user can also prune own private timetables.
